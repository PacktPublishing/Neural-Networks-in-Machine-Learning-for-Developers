# Neural Networks in Machine Learning for Developers [Video]
This is the code repository for [Neural Networks in Machine Learning for Developers [Video]](https://www.packtpub.com/web-development/neural-networks-machine-learning-developers-video?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781789139792), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the video course from start to finish.
## About the Video Course
Most of us have heard about the term Machine Learning, but surprisingly the question frequently asked by developers across the Globe is, "How do I get started in Machine Learning?" One reason could be the vastness of the subject area because people often get overwhelmed by the abstractness of ML and terms such as regression, supervised learning, probability density function, and so on. This systematic guide will teach you various Machine Learning techniques. 

You will start with the very basics of neural networks and types. Then we learn about powerful variations in neural networks and Recurrent Neural Networks. Finally, we conclude with a synthetic introduction to more advanced Machine Learning techniques, such as GANs and reinforcement learning.
